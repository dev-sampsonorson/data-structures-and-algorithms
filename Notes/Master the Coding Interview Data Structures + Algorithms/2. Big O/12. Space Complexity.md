# Space Complexity
*During program execution, the program remembers things with the **heap** and **stack** *
*The **heap** is where we store variables we assign*
*The **stack** is where we keep track of our function calls*
*In space complexity, we talk about additional space*
*We don't talk about space taken up by the input*

### What causes space complexity?
1. Variables
2. Data Structures
3. Function Calls
4. Allocations

### Example
```
// Space Complexity = O(1)
public void Boooooo() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n.Length; i++) {
        Console.WriteLine("boooooo!");
    }
}
```

```
// Space Complexity = O(n)
private string[] ArrayOfHiNTimes(int n) {
    string[] hiArray = new string[n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        hiArray[i] = "hi";
    }
    return hiArray;
}
```
