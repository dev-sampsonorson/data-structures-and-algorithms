*Scalable mean we worry about large inputs*
*If our inputs are small Big O doesn't matter much*
*Thinking long term about your code and what could happen in the future*
*Data structures are ways to store data*
*Algorithms are ways to use data structures to write programs*
*Data Structure + Algorithm = Programs*
