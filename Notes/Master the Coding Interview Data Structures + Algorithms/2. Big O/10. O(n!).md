# O(n!)
*If the loop is executed `n` times and the function in the loop executes `(n-1)!` steps, then a total of `n * (n-1)! = n!` steps will be performed. Which is exactly how you proof that this function's time complexity is in `Î˜(n!)`*

### Example
```
private void NFacRuntimeFunc(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        NFacRuntimeFunc(n - 1);
    }
}
```
