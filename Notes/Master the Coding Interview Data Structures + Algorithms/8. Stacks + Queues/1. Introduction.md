# Introduction
*stacks and queues are linear data structures*
*linear data structures allow us to go through data elements sequentially in which only one data element can be directly reached*
*the difference is in how items get removed*
*there is no random access in stacks and queues*
*stacks and queues are higher level data structures that a built on top lower level data structures like linked list and arrays, which limit the operations you can do on them*

### Stacks
*LIFO - plates, books*

**Methods**
- lookup O(n)
- pop O(1)
- push O(1)
- peek O(1)

### Queues
*FIFO*

**Methods**
- lookup O(n)
- enqueue O(1)
- dequeue O(1)
- peek O(1)
