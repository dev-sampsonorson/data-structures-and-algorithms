# Introduction
*sorting is most important when inputs get larger and larger*
*sorting is not a big deal with it comes to small input data*
*it cost a lot of money performing operations on really large data sets, sorting can make the operations minimal*
*most companies sort data or pre-process it*
*unsorted that is hard to access*
*sorted data makes it meaningful*
*what sorting algorithm should you use based on the problem*

### Algorithms
- bubble sort (elementary sort)
- insertion sort (elementary sort)
- selection sort  (elementary sort)
- merge sort
- quick sort
