# Merge
*use divide and conquer*
*any divide and conquer algorithms usually is (log n) advantage*
*space complexity is expensive*
*if sorting in-memory and worried about space complexity merge sort will be expensive*

**Time Complexity**
*best case - O(n log n)*
*average case O(n log n)*
*average case O(n log n)*

**Space Complexity**
*O(n)*
