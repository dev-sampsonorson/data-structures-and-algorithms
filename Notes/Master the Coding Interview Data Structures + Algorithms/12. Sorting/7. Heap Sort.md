# Heap Sort
Heapsort is a comparison-based [sorting algorithm](https://brilliant.org/wiki/sorting-algorithms/) that uses a [binary heap](https://brilliant.org/wiki/binary-heap/) data structure. Like [mergesort](https://brilliant.org/wiki/merge/), heapsort has a running time of O(n\\log n),O(nlogn), and like [insertion sort](https://brilliant.org/wiki/insertion/), heapsort sorts **in-place**, so no extra space is needed during the sort.

The binary heap data structure allows the heapsort algorithm to take advantage of the heap's **heap properties** and the heapsort algorithm makes use of the efficient running time for inserting to and deleting from the heap.
