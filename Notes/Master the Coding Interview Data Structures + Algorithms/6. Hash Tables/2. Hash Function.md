# Hash Function
*given the same input, it will always produce the same output; called idempotent*
*because of the hash we get fast data access, it points us to the location of our data in memory*
*the hash function takes time to run*
*hash functions are implemented to be fast*
*SHA-256 take a long time to generate a hash and it's complex*
