# How Computers Store Data
*CPU, RAM, Storage*
*Variables are stored in the RAM*
*CPU can access the RAM faster than Storage*
*8 bits can store 256 unique values given the count starts at 0*

### RAM & CPU
*Seen as a shelf that is numbered; called addresses*
*Each shelf holds 8 bits, which is a byte*
*The CPU is connected to a memory controller*
*The memory controller does the actual reading and writing to the RAM*
*Computer get extra speed boost then reading memory addresses that are close to each other*
*The CPU has a cache for optimization, which is a really tiny memory of stuff that is really recent*
