# Singly vs Doubly Linked List
### Singly Linked List
**Advantage**
- Simple implementation
- Less memory
- It's a little fast for certain operations given no previous point
- Fast insertion and deletion

**Disadvantage**
- Cannot be traversed in reverse
- If we loose the reference to "head", the list might be lost in memory forever

### Doubly Linked List
**Advantage**
- Can be traverse from the front or back
- Deleting a previous node is easy
- Good for searching

**Disadvantage**
- Required more memory
- Complex to implement
- Extra operation to update previous node
