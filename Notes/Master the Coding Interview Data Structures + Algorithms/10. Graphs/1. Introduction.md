# Introduction
*one of the most useful and used data structure in computer science*
*each item is called a node or vertex*
*nodes are connected with edges*
*graphs are good at modeling real world relationships*
*you can used graphs to represent friendships, networks, world wide web, road, and family tress*
*values can be applied to various aspects of a graph not just the nodes*
*the nodes can carry any type of information*

### Advantages
- Relationships

### Disadvantages
- Scaling is hard

### Types of Graphs
- directed
- undirected
- weighted 
- unweighted
- cyclic
- acyclic

**Directed**
*best used to describe traffic flow (one way street) or the system where the movement is not bi-directional*
*twitter is more directed; when people follow me, i don't have to follow them*

**Undirected**
*Facebook uses undirected graph - when i am connected to a friend the friend is also connected to me*
