# Binary Trees
*each node can have zero, one, or two nodes*
*each child can only have one parent*

### Perfect Binary Tree
*has everything filled in, that means all the leaf nodes are full*
*there is no node that only has one child*
*a node either has zero or two children*
*the bottom layer of the tree is completely filled, nothing is missing*
*the number of total nodes on each level doubles as we move down the tree*
*the number of nodes on the last level is equal to the sum of the number of nodes on all the other levels plus one*

### Full Tree
*a node can have one child node*

### Big O
- lookup - O(log N)
- insert - O(log N)
- delete - O(log N)
