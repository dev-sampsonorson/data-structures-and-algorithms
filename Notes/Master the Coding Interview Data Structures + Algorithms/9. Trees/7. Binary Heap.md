# Binary Heap
*only two children to a node*
*every child belongs to a parent that has a greater priority or value*
*binary heap a great at doing comparative operations - just like saying i want people that have a value over 33*
*grabbing people over 33 would be hard with binary search tree*
*heaps are used a lot in data storage, priority queues, sorting algorithms*
*there is no concept of an unbalance binary heap*

**memory heap is not the same as the heap data structure**

### Advantages
- better than O(n)
- priority
- flexible size
- fast insert

### Disadvantages
- slow lookup

### Big O
- lookup O(n)
- insert O(log n)
- delete O(log n)
