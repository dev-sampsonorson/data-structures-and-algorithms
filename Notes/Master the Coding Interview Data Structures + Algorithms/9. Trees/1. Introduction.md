# Introduction
*trees have a hierarchical structure*
*trees can have zero or more child nodes*
*trees start with a root or parent node*
*every child from the tree descends for this root node*
*every child descends from only one parent*
*leave nodes are at the very end of a tree data structure*
*within a tree, you can have sub-trees*
*nodes don't have to reference their parent*
*sibling nodes are nodes at the same level in a tree*
