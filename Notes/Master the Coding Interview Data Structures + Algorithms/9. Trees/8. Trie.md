# Trie
*a specialized tree used in searching; most often with text*
*in most cases it can out-perform binary search trees, hash tables, and most other data structures talked about*
*tries allow you to know if a word or part of a word exists in a body of text*
*trie has an empty root node*
*the benefit is speed and space*
*O(length of word)*
*space is saved because of the prefixes*
