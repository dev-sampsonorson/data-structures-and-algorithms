# Introduction
*steps in a process that we take to perform a desired action with computers*
*algorithms allow us to use data structures to perform actions on data*
*Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs*

### Why Important
*Big O and scalability of code are important as companies get larger*
*with algorithms you scale your code to improve your program*

### Data Structures
- Arrays
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Tries
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

### Algorithms
- Sorting
- Dynamic Programming
- BFS + DFS (Searching)
- Recursion
