# Recursion Introduction
*recursion is a concept used to write algorithms*
*risk of being difficult to understand or cause stack overflow*
*the function gets closer and closer to the base case*

### Anatomy
*recursive functions have two paths;*
**Base Case**
*the case that tells the function to stop calling itself*

**Recursive Case**
*the case that calls the function*

### Steps

1. Identify the base case
2. Identify the recursive case
3. Get closer and closer and return when needed. Usually you have 2 returns
