# When To Use Recursion
*every time you are using a tree or converting something into a tree, consider recursion*
*divide and conquer using recursion*
*a problem can be divided into a number of sub-problems that are smaller instances of the same problem*
*each instance of the sub-problem is identical in nature*
*the solutions of each sub-problem can be combined to solve the problem at hand*
