### Keys
- If apply directly through a company's job board please stop
- 30% of hires made by organizations came from referrals (the number one way)

- Apply to companies where your friends and colleges can refer you
- Instead of sending a resume, send them your portfolio, why you want to work for them, and request for an interview (send to HR or person on development team)
- Ask to take them for coffee or lunch
- The key is not to ask them for a job
- Let them know you are interested in getting where they are professionally
- Ask them if you can come by to the office to chat with them about their careers
- People love talking about themselves
- Message CEOs directly (works better for small companies)
- Personalize your emails and try to avoid sending a resume if you can
- Try to bypass formalities of the application process
- Cover letters are synonymous to sending emails, which is to introduce yourself
- Cover letters should be directed at some and personalized
